A Taste of Authentic Chinese Food

Little Egg

## What and Why?
Our product is called Little Egg and it will be a meal kit service focusing on Asian cuisine with an accompanying social media arm to build community. As can be seen from the growing popularity of meal kit services such as Blue Apron, Sun Basket, Hello Fresh, and more, the appetite of Americans who want to experience the fun of cooking without the usual hassle is there and only more evident as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Not only do people enjoy eating meals that they prepared, it is also a bonding/team building activity that is both fun and useful. At the same time, the convenience and health benefits of portioning, easy-to-make recipes, and pre-measured ingredients is what makes cooking more enjoyable for those with less experience. With that being said, there is a very obvious shortage in this world and that is Asian Cuisine, and that’s where Little Egg fills the gap.

Asian cuisine has become universally loved around the world ranging from American classics like Orange Chicken and Broccoli Beef to more authentic tastes like Mapo Tofu and Sichuan Grilled Fish. Though contrary to many of the meals currently provided in the existing services (such as Burgers, Grilled Chicken, Salads, etc), they are much harder to intuit for the average American. This is all the more reason to give people a hand in making their beloved dishes while allowing them to know exactly what is going into the dishes.

At the same time, there are hundreds of thousands of Asian-born students, scholars, and young workers in the U.S. that long for a traditional homemade dish that may be hard to find for them. Our service therefore allows them to have an authentic taste of home while they are abroad.

Lastly, we will incorporate a social media arm to our service allowing users to share their own recipes, pictures, posts, and updates to build a community of Little Eggs. This friendship and camaraderie will further incentivize people to try the product, stay with the community, and once the pandemic clears up – allow people to organize gatherings and picnics where they can show off what they’ve made. We will also give users the opportunity to share their own recipes and see if there is enough interest for it to become an official kit (and get some rev-share).

The reasons for developing Little Egg is simple, we want to fill the gap that is missing in meal prep services that features Asian cuisine. Whether you are a born and bred American from the Middle West who grew up eating Salt and Pepper Beef from Panda Express, or the newcomer who longs for a nice bowl of congee. We want to give people the affordable, healthy, convenient, and enjoyable experience of making their favorite dishes at home while being able to meet others doing the same and sharing ideas.
